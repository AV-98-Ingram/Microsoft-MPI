  - [**MPI\_Dist\_graph\_create**](mpi-dist-graph-create-function.md)  
    Returns a handle to a new communicator to which the distributed graph topology information is attached.

  - [**MPI\_Dist\_graph\_create\_adjacent**](mpi-dist-graph-create-adjacent-function.md)  
    Returns a handle to a new communicator to which the distributed graph topology information is attached.

  - [**MPI\_Dist\_graph\_neighbors**](mpi-dist-graph-neighbors-function.md)  
    Returns the list of neighbors having edges into and out of the calling process, as well as the corresponding weights on the incoming and outgoing edges in a distributed graph topology.

  - [**MPI\_Dist\_graph\_neighbors\_count**](mpi-dist-graph-neighbors-count-function.md)  
    Obtains adjacency information of the calling process in a distributed graph topology. The information that is obtained by this function, on the number of incoming edges, outgoing edges, and a flag indicating if the distributed graph is weighted, matches the information provided in the call to [**MPI\_Dist\_graph\_create\_adjacent**](mpi-dist-graph-create-adjacent-function.md) or [**MPI\_Dist\_graph\_create**](mpi-dist-graph-create-function.md) (by the calling process in the case of **MPI\_Dist\_graph\_create\_adjacent**, or potentially by processes other than the calling process in the case of **MPI\_Dist\_graph\_create**).
